# Climagotchi


## What is Climagotchi?

Climagotchi is a sustainability simulator.

Climagotchi is a game in which players act as governments to make decisions
impacting spending and interventions on environmental and social issues.

Climagotchi was brought into this world on 28 April 2021, by Michael
Hayman. My plan is to grow the codebase (including HTML and the rest) by
an average of 1,000 lines per week, and have the app running as a
fully-functional game and educational resource within 100 days (about 15
weeks). With any luck, it will also have an active community by that point
to drive it forward.

Future versions of Climagotchi will add complexity to climate models and
player interactions, uising Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language
Processing.

Climagotchi is the creation of Michael Hayman, who is always happy to chat
more about it, along with the potential of gameified policy to help us
understand our underlying ethical assumptions, biases, and visions for a
sustainable future. Please feel free to get in touch.

## How to play



## How is Climagotchi built?

The core of Climagotchi is a web app - a backend built in Python with the Flask
package, and a frontend built in HTML and CSS. I've taken a strategic decision
not to use JavaScript initially, but plan to integrate JavaScript in future
versions where it may add necessary functionality.


## What else can you do with Scarecrow?

As a user, you don't need to be an expert in any of the languages or libraries
used for Scarecrow, but you are free to customise your Scarecrow app if you know
how to use them. The base apps don't integrate and JavaScript, so they're simple
and predictable, but there's nothing stopping you from adding some JavaScript
elements into your Scarecrow app.

## How can you contribute?

Scarecrow was established by Michael Hayman, who is fully responsible for its
development and maintenance. If you would like to collaborate with me, or
contribute to Scarecrow, please email mdghayman@gmail.com to share your
proposal and your background.
