# Climagotchi


## What is Climagotchi?

Climagotchi is a sustainability simulator.

Climagotchi is a game in which players act as governments to make decisions
impacting spending and interventions on environmental and social issues.

Climagotchi was brought into this world on 28 April 2021, by Michael
Hayman. My plan is to grow the codebase (including HTML and the rest) by
an average of 1,000 lines per week, and have the app running as a
fully-functional game and educational resource within 100 days (about 15
weeks). With any luck, it will also have an active community by that point
to drive it forward.

Future versions of Climagotchi will add complexity to climate models and
player interactions, uising Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language
Processing.

Climagotchi is the creation of Michael Hayman, who is always happy to chat
more about it, along with the potential of gameified policy to help us
understand our underlying ethical assumptions, biases, and visions for a
sustainable future. Please feel free to get in touch.

## How to play



## How is Climagotchi built?

The core of Climagotchi is a web app - a backend built in Python with the Flask
package, and a frontend built in HTML and CSS. I've taken a strategic decision
not to use JavaScript initially, but plan to integrate JavaScript in future
versions where it may add necessary functionality.


## Goals and future milestones

I've committed to grow Climagotchi at a rate of 1,000 lines of code per week,
for the first 15 weeks. This is a net amount, so when I get into some serious
cleaning and refactoring of code, I'll need to replace any lines removed with
new lines. The total lines of code includes all files in this repository - the
app backend in Python with Flask, the app frontend in HTML and CSS, all of the
game logic, and written resources like this README file. I'll keep a running
total now, to show how the total size grows over the first 15 weeks:

| Week   | Date          | Lines of code |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Week 0 | 27 April 2021 | 0 lines       |
| Week 1 | 4 May 2021    | 1,280 lines   |
| Week 2 | 11 May 2021   | 2,173 lines   |


## Further documentation

I'm writing game instructions into the app, complementing functionality as I
build it. This README file also serves as a reference including basic
instructions for using the app and playing the game.


## How can you contribute?

Scarecrow was established by Michael Hayman, who is fully responsible for its
development and maintenance. If you would like to collaborate with me, or
contribute to Scarecrow, please email mdghayman@gmail.com to share your
proposal and your background.
